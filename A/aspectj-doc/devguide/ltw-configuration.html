                supports the definition of concrete aspects in XML. Aspects defined in this way
                must extend an abstract aspect visible to the weaver. The abstract aspect
                may define abstract pointcuts (but not abstract
                methods). The following example shows a simple aop.xml file: </p><pre class="programlisting">

                The DTD defining the format of this file is available here: 
                http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/dtd/aspectj.dtd. 
            </p><p>
                An aop.xml file contains two key sections: <code class="literal">aspects</code> defines one
                or more aspects to the weaver and controls which aspects are to be
                used in the weaving process; <code class="literal">weaver</code> defines weaver options and which
                types should be woven.
            </p><p>
                The simplest way to define an aspect to the weaver is to 
                specify the fully-qualified name of the aspect type in an aspect element. 
                You can also
                declare (and define to the weaver) aspects inline in the aop.xml file.
                This is done using the <code class="literal">concrete-aspect</code> element. A concrete-aspect
                declaration must provide a pointcut definition for every abstract 
                pointcut in the abstract aspect it extends. This mechanism is a 
                useful way of externalizing configuration for infrastructure and
                auxiliary aspects where the pointcut definitions themselves can be
                considered part of the configuration of the service.
                Refer to the next section for more details.
            </p><p>
                The <code class="literal">aspects</code> element may optionally contain one or more <code class="literal">include</code> and
                <code class="literal">exclude</code> elements (by default, all defined aspects are used for weaving).
                Specifying include or exclude elements restricts the set of defined
                aspects to be used for weaving to those that are matched by an include
                pattern, but not by an exclude pattern. The <code class="literal">within</code> attribute accepts
                a type pattern of the same form as a within pcd, except that &amp;&amp;
                and || are replaced by 'AND' and 'OR'.
            </p><p>
                Note that <code class="literal">include</code> and <code class="literal">exclude</code> elements affect all aspects 
                declared to the weaver including those in other aop.xml files. To help avoid unexpected 
                behaviour a lint warning is issued
                if an aspect is not declared as a result of of applying these filters.
                Also note <code class="literal">aspect</code> and <code class="literal">concrete-aspect</code> elements
                must be used to declare aspects to the weaver i.e. <code class="literal">include</code> and <code class="literal">exclude</code>
                elements cannot be used find aspects on the class loader search path.
            </p><p>
                The <code class="literal">weaver</code> element is used to pass options to the weaver and to specify
                the set of types that should be woven. If no include elements are specified
                then all types visible to the weaver will be woven. In addition the <code class="literal">dump</code>
                element can be used capture on disk byte-code of woven classes for diagnostic purposes both before,
                in the case of those generated at runtime, and after the weaving process.
            </p><p> When several configuration files are visible from a given weaving class loader
                their contents are conceptually merged. 
                The files are merged in the order they are
                found on the search path (with a regular <code class="literal">getResourceAsStream</code> lookup)
                according to the following rules: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>The set of available aspects is the set of all

                However, if the same concrete aspect
                is defined in more than one aop.xml file then an error will be issued.
                A concrete aspect 
                defined in this way will be used to weave types loaded by the

                It will simply contain a (possibly empty) set of aspect elements; one for
                each abstract or concrete aspect defined. 
                When used in conjuction with the <code class="literal">-outjar</code> option
                a JAR is produced that can be used

                It is possible to make an abstract aspect concrete by means of the <code class="literal">META-INF/aop.xml</code>
                file. This is useful way to implement abstract pointcuts at deployment time, and also gives control
                over precedence through the <code class="literal">precedence</code> attribute of the
                <code class="literal">concrete-aspect</code> XML element.
                Consider the following:
            </p><pre class="programlisting">
            package mypack;

            @Aspect
            public abstract class AbstractAspect {

                @Pointcut
                abstract void scope();

                @Before("scope() &amp;&amp; execution(* *..doSome(..))")

                }
            }
            </pre><p>
                This aspect is equivalent to the following in code style:

                This aspect (in either style) can be made concrete using <code class="literal">META-INF/aop.xml</code>.
                It defines the abstract pointcut <code class="literal">scope()</code>. When using this mechanism the

                            as illustrated in this sample, this means the method that hosts the pointcut must be abstract,

		        <span class="emphasis"><em>A limitation of the implementation of this feature in AspectJ 1.5.0 is that aspects defined using

                The following XML definition shows a valid concrete sub-aspect for the abstract aspects above:
            </p><pre class="programlisting">
            &lt;aspectj&gt;

                It is important to remember that the <code class="literal">name</code> attribute in the
                <code class="literal">concrete-aspect</code> directive defines the fully qualified name that will be given to the
                concrete aspect. It must a valid class name because the aspect will be generated on the fly by the weaver.
                You must
                also ensure that there are no name collisions. Note that the concrete aspect will be
                defined at the classloader level for which the aop.xml is visible. This implies that if you need
                to use the <code class="literal">aspectof</code> methods to access the aspect instance(s) (depending on the perclause
                of the aspect it extends) you have to use the helper API <code class="literal">org.aspectj.lang.Aspects.aspectOf(..)</code>
                as in:

                As described in the previous section, the <code class="literal">concrete-aspect</code> element in
                <code class="literal">META-INF/aop.xml</code> gives the option to declare the precedence, just as
                <code class="literal">@DeclarePrecedence</code> or <code class="literal">declare precedence</code> do in

            </p><p>
                Sometimes it is necessary to declare precedence without extending any abstract aspect.
                It is therefore possible to use the <code class="literal">concrete-aspect</code>
                element without the <code class="literal">extends</code> attribute and without any
                <code class="literal">pointcut</code> nested elements, just a <code class="literal">precedence</code>

                This deployment time definitions is only declaring a precedence rule. You have to remember
                that the <code class="literal">name</code> attribute must be a valid fully qualified class name
                that will be then reserved for this concrete-aspect and must not conflict with other classes
                you deploy.

                            by the aspects that are declared to the same weaver.
