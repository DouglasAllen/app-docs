<h2><a name=1>C Module Example</a></h2>

<p>

This module demonstrates some guidelines to follow when creating an
AOLserver module.  Here they are in a nutshell:

<p>

1) Each module has a readme file.  The file can be named
README-modulename.txt or readme.txt (the first form is preferred).

<p>

2) Each file has an entry called "(dollar-sign)Header: (dollar-sign)"
near the top of the document.  This includes html, adp, tcl, java, c,
as well as any plain text file.  Data files directly read by a module
may be excluded.

<p>

3) The Makefile follows the format of the example provided here and
must be named "<b>Makefile</b>" (not "makefile"): <a
href=Makefile.txt>Makefile</a>

<p>

4) A ChangeLog file reflects the changes made to the code and must be
named "<b>ChangeLog</b>".  This can be a simple cut-and-paste of your
CVS log entry.  This is absolutely essential!  Emacs users can type
"C-x 4 a" to automatically create ChangeLog entries.  <a
href=ChangeLog.txt>ChangeLog</a>.

<p>

5) Modules should follow the AOLserver Engineering Manual guidelines
at http://aolserver.com/ as closely as possible.

<p>

6) CVS tags include the name of the module followed by the version.
This is typically "nsmodulename3_0" or "nsmodulename_v3_0" (or even
just "nsmodulename_v3").  Major and minor numbers are delimited by
underscores since CVS doesn't allow the use of the period character.
Tags should be done with care.

<p>

7) Try not to type cvs commands in your $TOP directory.  Always work
from the subdirectory.  The only exception to this is "cvs update" and
"cvs checkout".
