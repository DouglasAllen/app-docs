<h2><a name=1>AOLserver Configuration</a></h2>

<p>

AOLserver has many configurable parameters, all of which are set in
the AOLserver configuration file. This chapter provides a reference of
the configuration file structure and parameters so that you can edit
the configuration file directly.

<p>

By modifying and/or adding AOLserver configuration parameters, you
can:

<br>
  * Define multiple servers, one of which will run within each running AOLserver process.

<p>

<br>
* Define multiple database pools with different data sources that
 can be accessed by any or all of the servers.

<p>

<br>
* Configure various AOLserver capabilities or optionally-loaded
 modules for each of the servers.

<p>

 What is a database pool?

<p>

A database pool is a set of connections to a database. AOLserver
currently supports direct connections to the SOLID and Postgres
databases. AOLserver also supports an external connection to Sybase.
Third-party database drivers are available for Oracle, Informix, and
InterBase. As far as configuration is concerned, you simply specify a
database (or data source) that you want AOLserver to access. AOLserver
then manages a set of connections to the database that it uses
internally to efficiently process database operations. You can also
access these connections directly through the Tcl and C interfaces.

<p>

 What are the default AOLserver capabilities?

<p>

The following capabilites are provided by default for every server and
can be configured by manually editing the configuration file.

<p>

<br>
* ADPs: This capability allows you to embed Tcl scripts within an
 HTML page. The pages are parsed and run on the server when the
 page is accessed.

<p>

<br>
* db: This capability allows you to use AOLserver's database
 services.

<p>

<br>
* tcl: This capability allows you to use AOLserver's Tcl API. See
 the Tcl Developer's Guide for information on Tcl.

<p>

 What is an AOLserver module?

<p>

AOLserver modules are shared libraries or dynamically-linked libraries
that provide specific sets of capabilities that you can load in your
servers. The following modules are provided:

<p>

<br>
* nscgi: This capability allows you to run CGI programs from
 AOLserver.

<p>

<br>
* nscp: This module enables the control port interface that allows
 you to administer a running server.

<p>

<br>
* nslog: This module enables access logging in the CERN Common Log
 Format. The nslog module can also log the Refer and User-Agent
 client headers.

<p>

<br>
* nsperm: This module enables access control capabilities --
 defining users, groups, and permissions.

<p>

<br>
* nssock: This module enables communications using ordinary TCP/IP
 Internet sockets.

<p>

<br>
* nsvhr: This module enables virtual host redirection.

<p>

<br>
* nsunix: This module enables communications using the nsvhr module
 to proxy over a UNIX domain socket.

<p>

<h2><a name=2>Configuration File Structure</a></h2>

<p>

This section describes the format of the configuration file and
provides detailed information on individual AOLserver parameters.

<p>

The configuration file is normally the nsd.tcl file in the AOLserver
home directory (the directory where AOLserver was installed). You must
specify the configuration file when you start up AOLserver with the -c
command line flag.

<p>

The configuration file is a Tcl file that can be modified with a text
editor such as vi or emacs on Unix. The file is made up of named
sections with one or more parameters. Each section heading is of the
form "ns/...". Each parameter is composed of a parameter name and a
parameter value. The parameters of a section continue until a new
section is defined or until the end of the file.

<p>

The ns_section and ns_param Tcl functions are used to define each
section and the parameters for each section in the configuration file.
The general format of the configuration file is as follows:
 ns_section "ns/..."
 ns_param param-name param-value
 ...

<p>

Configuration file examples begin on page 79. The default
configuration file is shown on page 79.

<p>

<h2><a name=3>Configuration File Hierarchy</a></h2>

<p>

Although there are a large number of configurable parameters for
AOLserver, most of them are not required. Also, the parameters are
organized into a hierarchy branching off of the following main
sections, letting you configure AOLserver at a global level, configure
each server, and configure each database you will be accessing. This
hierarchy of sections allows you maximum flexibility to provide
exactly the capabilities you need on each server, including where
pages will be stored and which databases will be accessible.

<p>

<br>
* Parameters: This part of the configuration file contains
 parameters that apply to the AOLserver process:
 + ns/parameters specifies parameters such as the AOLserver home
directory.

<p>

<br>
* MIME Types: This part of the configuration file lists global MIME
 types.
 + ns/mimetypes maps file name extensions to content-type
headers.

<p>

<br>
* Servers: This part of the configuration file configures one or
 more servers, one of which that can be run within each AOLserver
 process. It is the top level in a hierarchy of sections for each
 server.
 + ns/servers lists and names all of the servers.
 + ns/server/servername configures an individual server.
 + ns/server/servername/adp configures AOLserver Dynamic Pages
(ADPs) for the server.
 + ns/server/servername/adp/parsers configures ADP parsers.
 + ns/server/servername/db configures database connections used
by the server.
 + ns/server/servername/fastpath configures fastpath serving of
static files.
 + ns/server/servername/realms configures logging realms for
individual modules.
 + ns/server/servername/redirects configures redirects.
 + ns/server/servername/tcl configures Tcl for the server.
 + ns/server/servername/modules lists the modules available to
each server.
o ns/server/servername/module/nscgi configures CGI
  (Common Gateway Interface) for the server. See also the
  CGI interpreters and CGI environment configuration
  sections on page 48 for additional CGI configuration.
o ns/server/servername/module/nscp configures the control
  port administration interface.
o ns/server/servername/module/nscp/users configures the
  users allowed to access the control port administration
  interface.
o ns/server/servername/module/nslog configures the access
  log module loaded into a server.
o ns/server/servername/module/nsperm configures the
  permissions module loaded into a server.
o ns/server/servername/module/nssock configures the
  sockets module loaded into a server.
o ns/server/servername/module/nsvhr configures the
  virtual host redirection module loaded into a server.
o ns/server/servername/module/nsvhr/maps configures
  virtual host redirection mappings.
o ns/server/servername/module/nsunix configures a UNIX
  domain socket driver.

<p>

<br>
* Database Drivers and Pools: This part of the configuration file
 configures the database drivers (the type of database you will be
 using) and the database pools (connections to the database).
 + ns/db/drivers lists the database drivers available to
AOLserver. Currently internal database drivers are available
for SOLID and Postgres. An external database driver is
available for Sybase.
o ns/db/driver/extname configures an external database
  driver.
 + ns/db/pools lists the database pools available to AOLserver.
o ns/db/pool/pool-name configures a database pool, which
  determines the database to access and how many
  connections there will be to it.

<p>

<br>
* CGI Interpreters: This section allows you to configure the
 interpreters to execute for CGI scripts that end with certain file
 extensions. For example, you can configure the perl.exe
 interpreter to be invoked for all CGI's that end in .pl.
 + ns/interps/interps-name defines an interps section for CGI
modules.

<p>

<br>
* CGI Environment: This section allows you to configure environment
 variables in addition to the standard CGI environment variables
 for all CGI's or specific CGI interpreters.
 + ns/environment/environment-name defines an environment
section for CGI modules.

<p>

<br>
* SGI IRIX Sproc-based Threads: This section configures sproc-based
 threads on either IRIX 5.3 or 6.2 (not the pthread-based approach
 available on IRIX 6.2).
 + ns/threads configures sproc-based threads.

<p>

The parameters for each of the configuration file sections are
described below.

<h2><a name=4>Configuration File Reference</a></h2>


The following link describes all the possible parameters that can be
set in each section of the configuration file. Note that some sections
are not necessary at all if a specific capability is not included. For
example, you don't need a section configuring the nslog module for a
server if that server does not include the nslog module.

<h2><a name=5>Example Configuration Files</a></h2>

<p>

 Default Configuration File

<p>

The default sample-config.tcl comes with AOLserver. There is one server defined,
server1, which contains the nscp, nslog, and nssock modules. You can
define multiple servers, but only one of them can be run with each
command line execution.  All this information is defined at the top of the file.

<p>
<a href=sample-config.tcl.txt>sample-config.tcl</a>

<p>

 Configuration for Multiple Database Pools

<p>

This configuration file defines one server named default and two
database pools named defdb and otherdb. A few things to note about
this configuration file are:

<p>

SOLID and Postgres database pools: The defdb database pool is
associated with an SOLID database, and the otherdb database pool is
associated with a Postgres database. (See the driver parameters in the
ns/db/pool/pool-name sections.)

<p>

SOLID and Postgres drivers: The drivers used for all of the defined
database pools are listed in the ns/db/drivers section.

<p>

Database pools accessible by each server: The pools parameter in the
ns/server/default/db section specifies which database pool the default
server has access to. In this example, the default server can access
both the otherdb and the defdb database pools.
