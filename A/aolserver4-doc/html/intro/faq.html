AOLserver binary builds for many platforms are at <a href="http://aolserver.com/">http://aolserver.com</a><br>
<br>
AOLserver is open-source. The source code is hosted at Source Forge and can

 be found at the following locations:

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://aolserver.com/">http://aolserver.com</a></li>
  <li>In CVS at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/aolserver/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/aolserver</a></li>
</ul>
<b><a name="Building_AOLserver"></a>Building AOLserver</b><br><br>
AOLserver builds very easily and the online documentation

 describes the process.  We recommend that you use the defaults in include/Makefile.global

 when building your module.  This file contains rules and knows how to build

 modules properly for all platforms AOLserver has been ported to. To link

 a shared object, we recommend the default which is:<br>
    <tt>gcc -shared -nostartfiles</tt><br>
<br>
On some Solaris installations the Cygnus compiler is unable to build working

 shared objects.  We're told that if you put the -Wl,-E option in the nsd/Makefile

 when linking the executable, Cygnus works, but we have not verified this

 successfully.  GCC from just about anywhere else <i>will</i> work. You can

 get a pre-built copy of GCC from <a href="http://www.sunfreeware.com/">http://www.sunfreeware.com</a> or

 build your own from <a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/">ftp://ftp.gnu.org</a>. Just install

 it and put a link to the new gcc in /usr/local/bin (keep the broken Cygnus

 in /usr/cygnus/bin in case you need it).  <br>
<br>
HINT: The magic option to GCC for the compiling step is "-fPIC", so if you're

 using a third-party library, make sure "-fPIC" appears in the CFLAGS. And,

 to eliminate the possibility of strange behavior, it's helpful but not necessary

 to build everything with the same compiler and using the same options. 

 If you're using a third-party library for which no source code is available,

 you may run into problems if the vendor did not build it with the equivalent

 of "-fPIC" on their compiler.  Shared objects must be position-independent.<br>

<br><b><a name="Obtaining_the_128bit_SSL_Module"></a>Obtaining the 128-bit SSL Module</b><br><br>
AOLserver supports two levels of SSL for "https" connections -- the export

 version, which has a 40-bit secret key and a 512-bit public keypair, and

 the domestic version, which has a 128-bit secret key and a 1024-bit public

 key.<br>

<br>

The 40-bit/512-bit version can be found at <a
href="http://aolserver.com/">http://aolserver.com</a> as
 part of the regular AOLserver source and binary distributions. The
 128-bit/1024-bit domestic version is not available in binary form.
 It can be built from the source code if you have the RSA BSAFE
 library from <a href=www.rsasecurity.com>RSA Data Security</a>.  If
 you do not wish to purchase RSA BSAFE, we highly recommend the
nsopenssl module instead of the nsssl module.  It can be found on
aolserver.com</a>.  The nsopenssl module supports several features
that nsssl
 does not including SSL v3, client-side certificates, and client-side
 SSL.  It requires the OpenSSL library which may or may not be legal
 to use in your situation.<br>

<br><b><a name="Installing_AOLserver"></a>Installing AOLserver</b><br><br>
Installing AOLserver is very straightforward and is covered in the online documentation.<br>
<br><b><a name="Database_Access"></a>Database Access</b><br><br>
AOLserver works with a great many databases including all the popular enterprise

 systems.<br>
<br>
 <b>Sybase Proxy Daemon (nssybpd)</b><br>
  <br>
The nssybpd connects AOLserver to a Sybase database. America Online does 
 not have a license to distribute the binary builds of this code externally 
 (and neither does anyone else).  The source code is located in the "nssybpd/" 
 directory of the AOLserver source tree at Source Forge and requires the 
 Sybase Client Libraries to build.
<br><br>
<b><a name="Getting_Help"></a>Getting Help</b><br><br>
AOLserver has an active developer community as well as a very active user

 community.  Links to these areas are at <a href="http://aolserver.com/">http://aolserver.com/</a>.<br>

<br><b><a name="Contributing_Software"></a>Contributing Software</b><br><br>
AOLserver is extremely extensible and we host a great many community-contributed 
 modules at <a href="http://aolserver.com/">http://aolserver.com/</a>.  You 
 can contribute your software by following the guidelines on that
 page.<br> <br><b><a name="Contributing_Patches"></a>Contributing
 Patches</b><br><br> We accept any form of patches at the Source Forge
 link on the left of this page.  We request that your
 patch include a test case and, if possible, a context diff against a tagged
 version of the AOLserver source code.  In lieu of a test case we can also
 accept a narrative describing the problem in detail.<br>
