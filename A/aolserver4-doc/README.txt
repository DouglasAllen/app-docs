AOLserver Documentation Guidelines
----------------------------------

These rules must be strictly adhered to.

    1) All documentation must be human-readable in either HTML or
       plain text format in character set US-ASCII.

    2) No documentation is to be machine-generated.  All documentation
       is to be maintained and edited by hand.

    3) Only AOLserver-specific documentation is to be include, e.g.,
       no Tcl manuals.

    4) Documentation is to be approved by qualified editors before
       publication.


Remember, text and HTML only!!
