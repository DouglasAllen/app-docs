      This section presents a brief introduction to the features of AspectJ
      used later in this chapter. These features are at the core of the
      language, but this is by no means a complete overview of AspectJ.
    </p><p>
      The features are presented using a simple figure editor system. A
      <code class="classname">Figure</code> consists of a number of
      <code class="classname">FigureElements</code>, which can be either
      <code class="classname">Point</code>s or <code class="classname">Line</code>s. The
      <code class="classname">Figure</code> class provides factory services. There
      is also a <code class="classname">Display</code>. Most example programs later
      in this chapter are based on this system as well.
    </p><p>

    </p><p>
      The motivation for AspectJ (and likewise for aspect-oriented
      programming) is the realization that there are issues or concerns
      that are not well captured by traditional programming
      methodologies. Consider the problem of enforcing a security policy in
      some application. By its nature, security cuts across many of the
      natural units of modularity of the application. Moreover, the
      security policy must be uniformly applied to any additions as the
      application evolves. And the security policy that is being applied
      might itself evolve. Capturing concerns like a security policy in a
      disciplined way is difficult and error-prone in a traditional
      programming language.
    </p><p>
      Concerns like security cut across the natural units of
      modularity. For object-oriented programming languages, the natural
      unit of modularity is the class. But in object-oriented programming
      languages, crosscutting concerns are not easily turned into classes
      precisely because they cut across classes, and so these aren't
      reusable, they can't be refined or inherited, they are spread through
      out the program in an undisciplined way, in short, they are difficult
      to work with.
    </p><p>
      Aspect-oriented programming is a way of modularizing crosscutting
      concerns much like object-oriented programming is a way of
      modularizing common concerns. AspectJ is an implementation of
      aspect-oriented programming for Java.
    </p><p>
      AspectJ adds to Java just one new concept, a join point -- and that's
      really just a name for an existing Java concept.  It adds to Java
      only a few new constructs: pointcuts, advice, inter-type declarations
      and aspects.  Pointcuts and advice dynamically affect program flow,
      inter-type declarations statically affects a program's class
      hierarchy, and aspects encapsulate these new constructs.
    </p><p>
      A <span class="emphasis"><em>join point</em></span> is a well-defined point in the
      program flow.  A <span class="emphasis"><em>pointcut</em></span> picks out certain join
      points and values at those points.  A piece of
      <span class="emphasis"><em>advice</em></span> is code that is executed when a join
      point is reached. These are the dynamic parts of AspectJ.
    </p><p>
      AspectJ also has different kinds of <span class="emphasis"><em>inter-type
      declarations</em></span> that allow the programmer to modify a
      program's static structure, namely, the members of its classes and
      the relationship between classes.
    </p><p>
      AspectJ's <span class="emphasis"><em>aspect</em></span> are the unit of modularity for
      crosscutting concerns.  They behave somewhat like Java classes, but
      may also include pointcuts, advice and inter-type declarations.
    </p><p>
      In the sections immediately following, we are first going to look at
      join points and how they compose into pointcuts. Then we will look at
      advice, the code which is run when a pointcut is reached. We will see
      how to combine pointcuts and advice into aspects, AspectJ's reusable,
      inheritable unit of modularity. Lastly, we will look at how to use
      inter-type declarations to deal with crosscutting concerns of a
      program's class structure.
    </p><div class="sect2" title="The Dynamic Join Point Model"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="the-dynamic-join-point-model"></a>The Dynamic Join Point Model</h3></div></div></div><p>
        A critical element in the design of any aspect-oriented language is
        the join point model. The join point model provides the common
        frame of reference that makes it possible to define the dynamic
        structure of crosscutting concerns.  This chapter describes
        AspectJ's dynamic join points, in which join points are certain
        well-defined points in the execution of the program.
      </p><p>
        AspectJ provides for many kinds of join points, but this chapter
        discusses only one of them: method call join points. A method call
        join point encompasses the actions of an object receiving a method
        call. It includes all the actions that comprise a method call,
        starting after all arguments are evaluated up to and including
        return (either normally or by throwing an exception).
      </p><p>
        Each method call at runtime is a different join point, even if it
        comes from the same call expression in the program.  Many other
        join points may run while a method call join point is executing --
        all the join points that happen while executing the method body,
        and in those methods called from the body.  We say that these join
        points execute in the <span class="emphasis"><em>dynamic context</em></span> of the
        original call join point.
      </p></div><div class="sect2" title="Pointcuts"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="pointcuts"></a>Pointcuts</h3></div></div></div><p>
        In AspectJ, <span class="emphasis"><em>pointcuts</em></span> pick out certain join
        points in the program flow. For example, the pointcut
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
call(void Point.setX(int))
</pre><p>
        picks out each join point that is a call to a method that has the
        signature <code class="literal">void Point.setX(int)</code> &#8212; that is,
        <code class="classname">Point</code>'s void <code class="function">setX</code>
        method with a single <code class="literal">int</code> parameter.
      </p><p>
        A pointcut can be built out of other pointcuts with and, or, and
        not (spelled <code class="literal">&amp;&amp;</code>, <code class="literal">||</code>,
        and <code class="literal">!</code>).  For example:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
call(void Point.setX(int)) ||
call(void Point.setY(int))
</pre><p>
        picks out each join point that is either a call to
        <code class="function">setX</code> or a call to <code class="function">setY</code>.
      </p><p>
        Pointcuts can identify join points from many different types
        &#8212; in other words, they can crosscut types.  For example,
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
call(void FigureElement.setXY(int,int)) ||
call(void Point.setX(int))              ||
call(void Point.setY(int))              ||
call(void Line.setP1(Point))            ||
call(void Line.setP2(Point));
</pre><p>
        picks out each join point that is a call to one of five methods
        (the first of which is an interface method, by the way).
      </p><p>
        In our example system, this pointcut captures all the join points
        when a <code class="classname">FigureElement</code> moves.  While this is a
        useful way to specify this crosscutting concern, it is a bit of a
        mouthful.  So AspectJ allows programmers to define their own named
        pointcuts with the <code class="literal">pointcut</code> form.  So the
        following declares a new, named pointcut:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
pointcut move():
    call(void FigureElement.setXY(int,int)) ||
    call(void Point.setX(int))              ||
    call(void Point.setY(int))              ||
    call(void Line.setP1(Point))            ||
    call(void Line.setP2(Point));
</pre><p>
        and whenever this definition is visible, the programmer can simply
        use <code class="literal">move()</code> to capture this complicated
        pointcut.
      </p><p>
        The previous pointcuts are all based on explicit enumeration of a
        set of method signatures. We sometimes call this
        <span class="emphasis"><em>name-based</em></span> crosscutting. AspectJ also
        provides mechanisms that enable specifying a pointcut in terms of
        properties of methods other than their exact name. We call this
        <span class="emphasis"><em>property-based</em></span> crosscutting. The simplest of
        these involve using wildcards in certain fields of the method
        signature. For example, the pointcut
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
call(void Figure.make*(..))
</pre><p>
        picks out each join point that's a call to a void method defined
        on <code class="classname">Figure</code> whose the name begins with
        "<code class="literal">make</code>" regardless of the method's parameters.
        In our system, this picks out calls to the factory methods
        <code class="function">makePoint</code> and <code class="function">makeLine</code>.
        The pointcut
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
call(public * Figure.* (..))
</pre><p>
        picks out each call to <code class="classname">Figure</code>'s public
        methods.
      </p><p>
        But wildcards aren't the only properties AspectJ supports.
        Another pointcut, <code class="function">cflow</code>, identifies join
        points based on whether they occur in the dynamic context of
        other join points.  So
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
cflow(move())
</pre><p>
        picks out each join point that occurs in the dynamic context of
        the join points picked out by <code class="literal">move()</code>, our named
        pointcut defined above.  So this picks out each join points that
        occurrs between when a move method is called and when it returns
        (either normally or by throwing an exception).
      </p></div><div class="sect2" title="Advice"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="advice"></a>Advice</h3></div></div></div><p>
        So pointcuts pick out join points.  But they don't
        <span class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> anything apart from picking out join
        points.  To actually implement crosscutting behavior, we use
        advice.  Advice brings together a pointcut (to pick out join
        points) and a body of code (to run at each of those join points).
      </p><p>
        AspectJ has several different kinds of advice. <span class="emphasis"><em>Before
        advice</em></span> runs as a join point is reached, before the
        program proceeds with the join point.  For example, before advice
        on a method call join point runs before the actual method starts
        running, just after the arguments to the method call are evaluated.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
before(): move() {
    System.out.println("about to move");
}
</pre><p>
        <span class="emphasis"><em>After advice</em></span> on a particular join point runs
        after the program proceeds with that join point.  For example,
        after advice on a method call join point runs after the method body
        has run, just before before control is returned to the caller.
        Because Java programs can leave a join point 'normally' or by
        throwing an exception, there are three kinds of after advice:
        <code class="literal">after returning</code>, <code class="literal">after
        throwing</code>, and plain <code class="literal">after</code> (which runs
        after returning <span class="emphasis"><em>or</em></span> throwing, like Java's
        <code class="literal">finally</code>).
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
after() returning: move() {
    System.out.println("just successfully moved");
}
</pre><p>
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Around advice</em></span> on a join point runs as the join
        point is reached, and has explicit control over whether the program
        proceeds with the join point.  Around advice is not discussed in
        this section.
      </p><div class="sect3" title="Exposing Context in Pointcuts"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idp4878352"></a>Exposing Context in Pointcuts</h4></div></div></div><p>
          Pointcuts not only pick out join points, they can also expose
          part of the execution context at their join points. Values
          exposed by a pointcut can be used in the body of advice
          declarations.
        </p><p>
          An advice declaration has a parameter list (like a method) that
          gives names to all the pieces of context that it uses.  For
          example, the after advice
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
after(FigureElement fe, int x, int y) returning:
        ...SomePointcut... {
    ...SomeBody...
}
</pre><p>
           uses three pieces of exposed context, a
           <code class="literal">FigureElement</code> named fe, and two
           <code class="literal">int</code>s named x and y.
         </p><p>
          The body of the advice uses the names just like method
          parameters, so
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
after(FigureElement fe, int x, int y) returning:
        ...SomePointcut... {
    System.out.println(fe + " moved to (" + x + ", " + y + ")");
}
</pre><p>
          The advice's pointcut publishes the values for the advice's
          arguments.  The three primitive pointcuts
          <code class="literal">this</code>, <code class="literal">target</code> and
          <code class="literal">args</code> are used to publish these values.  So now
          we can write the complete piece of advice:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
after(FigureElement fe, int x, int y) returning:
        call(void FigureElement.setXY(int, int))
        &amp;&amp; target(fe)
        &amp;&amp; args(x, y) {
    System.out.println(fe + " moved to (" + x + ", " + y + ")");
}
</pre><p>
          The pointcut exposes three values from calls to
          <code class="function">setXY</code>: the target
          <code class="classname">FigureElement</code> -- which it publishes as
          <code class="literal">fe</code>, so it becomes the first argument to the
          after advice -- and the two int arguments -- which it publishes
          as <code class="literal">x</code> and <code class="literal">y</code>, so they become
          the second and third argument to the after advice.
        </p><p>
          So the advice prints the figure element
          that was moved and its new <code class="literal">x</code> and
          <code class="literal">y</code> coordinates after each
          <code class="classname">setXY</code> method call.
        </p><p>
          A named pointcut may have parameters like a piece of advice.
          When the named pointcut is used (by advice, or in another named
          pointcut), it publishes its context by name just like the
          <code class="literal">this</code>, <code class="literal">target</code> and
          <code class="literal">args</code> pointcut.  So another way to write the
          above advice is
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
pointcut setXY(FigureElement fe, int x, int y):
    call(void FigureElement.setXY(int, int))
    &amp;&amp; target(fe)
    &amp;&amp; args(x, y);

after(FigureElement fe, int x, int y) returning: setXY(fe, x, y) {
    System.out.println(fe + " moved to (" + x + ", " + y + ").");
}
</pre></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Inter-type declarations"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="inter-type-declarations"></a>Inter-type declarations</h3></div></div></div><p>
        Inter-type declarations in AspectJ are declarations that cut across
        classes and their hierarchies.  They may declare members that cut
        across multiple classes, or change the inheritance relationship
        between classes.  Unlike advice, which operates primarily
        dynamically, introduction operates statically, at compile-time.
      </p><p>
        Consider the problem of expressing a capability shared by some
        existing classes that are already part of a class hierarchy,
        i.e. they already extend a class.  In Java, one creates an
        interface that captures this new capability, and then adds to
        <span class="emphasis"><em>each affected class</em></span> a method that implements
        this interface.
      </p><p>
        AspectJ can express the concern in one place, by using inter-type
        declarations.  The aspect declares the methods and fields that are
        necessary to implement the new capability, and associates the
        methods and fields to the existing classes.
      </p><p>
        Suppose we want to have <code class="classname">Screen</code> objects
        observe changes to <code class="classname">Point</code> objects, where
        <code class="classname">Point</code> is an existing class. We can implement
        this by writing an aspect declaring that the class Point
        <code class="classname">Point</code> has an instance field,
        <code class="varname">observers</code>, that keeps track of the
        <code class="classname">Screen</code> objects that are observing
        <code class="classname">Point</code>s.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
aspect PointObserving {
    private Vector Point.observers = new Vector();
    ...
}
</pre><p>
        The <code class="literal">observers</code> field is private, so only
        <code class="classname">PointObserving</code> can see it.  So observers are
        added or removed with the static methods
        <code class="function">addObserver</code> and
        <code class="function">removeObserver</code> on the aspect.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
aspect PointObserving {
    private Vector Point.observers = new Vector();

    public static void addObserver(Point p, Screen s) {
        p.observers.add(s);
    }
    public static void removeObserver(Point p, Screen s) {
        p.observers.remove(s);
    }
    ...
}
</pre><p>
        Along with this, we can define a pointcut
        <code class="function">changes</code> that defines what we want to observe,
        and the after advice defines what we want to do when we observe a
        change.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
aspect PointObserving {
    private Vector Point.observers = new Vector();

    public static void addObserver(Point p, Screen s) {
        p.observers.add(s);
    }
    public static void removeObserver(Point p, Screen s) {
        p.observers.remove(s);
    }

    pointcut changes(Point p): target(p) &amp;&amp; call(void Point.set*(int));

    after(Point p): changes(p) {
        Iterator iter = p.observers.iterator();
        while ( iter.hasNext() ) {
            updateObserver(p, (Screen)iter.next());
        }
    }

    static void updateObserver(Point p, Screen s) {
        s.display(p);
    }
}
</pre><p>
        Note that neither <code class="classname">Screen</code>'s nor
        <code class="classname">Point</code>'s code has to be modified, and that
        all the changes needed to support this new capability are local to
        this aspect.
      </p></div><div class="sect2" title="Aspects"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="aspects"></a>Aspects</h3></div></div></div><p>
        Aspects wrap up pointcuts, advice, and inter-type declarations in a
        a modular unit of crosscutting implementation.  It is defined very
        much like a class, and can have methods, fields, and initializers
        in addition to the crosscutting members.  Because only aspects may
        include these crosscutting members, the declaration of these
        effects is localized.
      </p><p>
        Like classes, aspects may be instantiated, but AspectJ controls how
        that instantiation happens -- so you can't use Java's
        <code class="literal">new</code> form to build new aspect instances.  By
        default, each aspect is a singleton, so one aspect instance is
        created.  This means that advice may use non-static fields of the
        aspect, if it needs to keep state around:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
aspect Logging {
    OutputStream logStream = System.err;

    before(): move() {
        logStream.println("about to move");
    }
}
</pre><p>
        Aspects may also have more complicated rules for instantiation, but
        these will be described in a later chapter.
