BUGS
 ( ) manpage.tpl fails unless all options have a short form

WISHLIST
 ( ) write autoproject info page (may wait until emacs command C-c C-u
C-e is fixed so it won't ruin menus)
 ( ) implement automatically updated info page

 ( ) Extend interview, to request any additional long options, as in:
  
  What other long option will foobar have, if any?: author
  Equivalent short option, if any [none]:
  What will the option do (short description)?  
  add a comment to the output file
  What kind of argument will it accept: None, Optional, or Required? [Nor]: o

  What other long option will foobar have, if any?:

 ( ) enable creation and population of subdirectories (doc, src, etc.)
 ( ) provide for executable scripts
 ( ) provide for GTK+, QT, and other GUI toolkits.
 ( ) offer various licenses (public domain, GPL, LGPL, BSD, GFDL)
 ( ) use gettext if configure finds it
 ( ) offer to embed argp or gettext sources in the package, but use
the version in libc or libintl if available and recent enough
