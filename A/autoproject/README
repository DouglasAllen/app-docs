	autoproject - create a skeleton source package for a new program

autoproject interviews the user, then creates a source package for a
new program which follows the GNU programming standards.  The new
package uses autoconf to configure itself, and automake to create the
Makefile.  `make distcheck' succeeds.

The idea is that you execute autoproject just once when you start a
new project.  It will ask a few questions, then create a new directory
and populate it with standard files, customized for the new project.

The version number for the new program is initialized as 0.1.0, and is
set in configure.in.  It is available in C programs as the macro
VERSION, and in the Makefile as $(VERSION).

Optionally, the new package will use an external command line parser
or a parser generator.  Currently, autoproject supports:

 	argp by Miles Bader, included in GNU C Library 2.1
	clig by Harald Kirsch <kirschh@lionbioscience.com> 
                (see http://wsd.iitb.fhg.de/~kir/clighome/)
        autogen by Bruce Korb <bkorb@gnu.org>
                (see http://AutoGen.SourceForge.net/autoopts/)

I would like to support graphical user interface (GUI) as well as
command line interface (CLI) programs, but I have very little
experience with them.  Contributions would be welcome.
