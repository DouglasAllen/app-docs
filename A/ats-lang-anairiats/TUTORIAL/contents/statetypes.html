A state type is a mapping that associates variables with viewtypes.
Intuitively, if a program point can be assigned a state type <EM>ST</EM>,
then each variable in the domain of <EM>ST</EM> must have the type with
which <EM>ST</EM> associates the variable when program execution reaches
that point. In ATS, a state type is represented as follows:

<pre>
(x_1 : VT_1, ..., x_n : VT_n)
</pre>

where for <EM>1 &lt= i &lt= n</EM>, each variable <EM>x_i</EM> is
assiciated with the viewtype <EM>VT_i</EM>.
