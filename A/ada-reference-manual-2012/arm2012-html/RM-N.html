<div class="paranum">1/2</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I8798"></A>This Annex contains informal 
descriptions of some of the terms used in this International Standard. 
The index provides references to more formal definitions of all of the 
terms used in this International Standard.</div>
<div class="paranum">1.1/2</div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="I8799"></A><B>Abstract type.</B> An abstract 
type is a tagged type intended for use as an ancestor of other types, 
but which is not allowed to have objects of its own.</div>
<div class="paranum">2</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I8800"></A><B>Access type.</B> An access 
type has values that designate aliased objects. Access types correspond 
to &ldquo;pointer types&rdquo; or &ldquo;reference types&rdquo; in some 
other languages.</div>
<div class="paranum">3</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I8801"></A><B>Aliased.</B> An aliased view 
of an object is one that can be designated by an access value. Objects 
allocated by allocators are aliased. Objects can also be explicitly declared 
as aliased with the reserved word <B>aliased</B>. The Access attribute 
can be used to create an access value designating an aliased object.</div>
<div class="paranum">3.1/2</div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="I8802"></A><B>Ancestor.</B> An ancestor 
of a type is the type itself or, in the case of a type derived from other 
types, its parent type or one of its progenitor types or one of their 
ancestors. Note that ancestor and descendant are inverse relationships.</div>
<div class="paranum">4</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I8803"></A><B>Array type.</B> An array type 
is a composite type whose components are all of the same type. Components 
are selected by indexing.</div>
<div class="paranum">4.1/3</div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="I8804"></A><B>Aspect.</B> An aspect is 
a specifiable property of an entity. An aspect may be specified by an 
<SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="RM-13-1-1.html#S0306">aspect_specification</A></SPAN> 
on the declaration of the entity. Some aspects may be queried via attributes.</div>
<div class="paranum">4.2/3</div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="I8805"></A><B>Assertion.</B> An assertion 
is a boolean expression that appears in any of the following: a <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="RM-2-8.html#S0019">pragma</A></SPAN> 
Assert, a predicate, a precondition, a postcondition, an invariant, a 
constraint, or a null exclusion. An assertion is expected to be True 
at run time at certain specified places.</div>
<div class="paranum">4.3/2</div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="I8806"></A><B>Category (of types).</B> 
A category of types is a set of types with one or more common properties, 
such as primitive operations. A category of types that is closed under 
derivation is also known as a <I>class</I>.</div>
<div class="paranum">5</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I8807"></A><B>Character type.</B> A character 
type is an enumeration type whose values include characters.</div>
<div class="paranum">6/2</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I8808"></A><B>Class (of types).</B> <A NAME="I8809"></A>A 
class is a set of types that is closed under derivation, which means 
that if a given type is in the class, then all types derived from that 
type are also in the class. The set of types of a class share common 
properties, such as their primitive operations.</div>
<div class="paranum">7</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I8810"></A><B>Compilation unit.</B> The 
text of a program can be submitted to the compiler in one or more <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="RM-10-1-1.html#S0246">compilation</A></SPAN>s. 
Each <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="RM-10-1-1.html#S0246">compilation</A></SPAN> 
is a succession of <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="RM-10-1-1.html#S0247">compilation_unit</A></SPAN>s. 
A <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="RM-10-1-1.html#S0247">compilation_unit</A></SPAN> 
contains either the declaration, the body, or a renaming of a program 
unit.</div>
<div class="paranum">8/2</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I8811"></A><B>Composite type.</B> A composite 
type may have components.</div>
<div class="paranum">9</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I8812"></A><B>Construct.</B> A <I>construct</I> 
is a piece of text (explicit or implicit) that is an instance of a syntactic 
category defined under &ldquo;Syntax&rdquo;.</div>
<div class="paranum">9.1/3</div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="I8813"></A><B>Container.</B> A container 
is an object that contain other objects all of the same type, which could 
be class-wide. Several predefined container types are provided by the 
children of package Ada.Containers (see <A HREF="RM-A-18-1.html">A.18.1</A>).</div>
<div class="paranum">10</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I8814"></A><B>Controlled type.</B> A controlled 
type supports user-defined assignment and finalization. Objects are always 
finalized before being destroyed.</div>
<div class="paranum">11</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I8815"></A><B>Declaration.</B> A <I>declaration</I> 
is a language construct that associates a name with (a view of) an entity. 
<A NAME="I8816"></A><A NAME="I8817"></A>A declaration may appear explicitly 
in the program text (an <I>explicit</I> declaration), or may be supposed 
to occur at a given place in the text as a consequence of the semantics 
of another construct (an <I>implicit</I> declaration).</div>
<div class="paranum">12/2</div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;<SPAN STYLE="font-size: 80%"><I>This paragraph was 
deleted.</I></SPAN>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="paranum">13/2</div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;<A NAME="I8818"></A><B>Derived type.</B> A derived 
type is a type defined in terms of one or more other types given in a 
derived type definition. The first of those types is the parent type 
of the derived type and any others are progenitor types. Each class containing 
the parent type or a progenitor type also contains the derived type. 
The derived type inherits properties such as components and primitive 
operations from the parent and progenitors. A type together with the 
types derived from it (directly or indirectly) form a derivation class.</div>
<div class="paranum">13.1/2</div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="I8819"></A><B>Descendant.</B> A type 
is a descendant of itself, its parent and progenitor types, and their 
ancestors. Note that descendant and ancestor are inverse relationships.</div>
<div class="paranum">14</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I8820"></A><B>Discrete type.</B> A discrete 
type is either an integer type or an enumeration type. Discrete types 
may be used, for example, in <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="RM-5-4.html#S0154">case_statement</A></SPAN>s 
and as array indices.</div>
<div class="paranum">15/2</div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;<A NAME="I8821"></A><B>Discriminant.</B> A discriminant 
is a parameter for a composite type. It can control, for example, the 
bounds of a component of the type if the component is an array. A discriminant 
for a task type can be used to pass data to a task of the type upon creation.</div>
<div class="paranum">15.1/2</div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="I8822"></A><B>Elaboration.</B> The process 
by which a declaration achieves its run-time effect is called elaboration. 
Elaboration is one of the forms of execution.</div>
<div class="paranum">16</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I8823"></A><B>Elementary type.</B> An elementary 
type does not have components.</div>
<div class="paranum">17</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I8824"></A><B>Enumeration type.</B> An enumeration 
type is defined by an enumeration of its values, which may be named by 
identifiers or character literals.</div>
<div class="paranum">17.1/2</div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="I8825"></A><B>Evaluation.</B> The process 
by which an expression achieves its run-time effect is called evaluation. 
Evaluation is one of the forms of execution.</div>
<div class="paranum">18</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I8826"></A><B>Exception.</B> An <I>exception</I> 
represents a kind of exceptional situation; an occurrence of such a situation 
(at run time) is called an <I>exception occurrence</I>. <A NAME="I8827"></A>To 
<I>raise</I> an exception is to abandon normal program execution so as 
to draw attention to the fact that the corresponding situation has arisen. 
<A NAME="I8828"></A>Performing some actions in response to the arising 
of an exception is called <I>handling</I> the exception.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="paranum">19</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I8829"></A><B>Execution.</B> The process 
by which a construct achieves its run-time effect is called <I>execution</I>. 
<A NAME="I8830"></A><A NAME="I8831"></A>Execution of a declaration is 
also called <I>elaboration</I>. Execution of an expression is also called 
<I>evaluation</I>.</div>
<div class="paranum">19.1/2</div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="I8832"></A><B>Function.</B> A function 
is a form of subprogram that returns a result and can be called as part 
of an expression.</div>
<div class="paranum">20</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I8833"></A><B>Generic unit.</B> A generic 
unit is a template for a (nongeneric) program unit; the template can 
be parameterized by objects, types, subprograms, and packages. An instance 
of a generic unit is created by a <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="RM-12-3.html#S0275">generic_instantiation</A></SPAN>. 
The rules of the language are enforced when a generic unit is compiled, 
using a generic contract model; additional checks are performed upon 
instantiation to verify the contract is met. That is, the declaration 
of a generic unit represents a contract between the body of the generic 
and instances of the generic. Generic units can be used to perform the 
role that macros sometimes play in other languages.</div>
<div class="paranum">20.1/2</div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="I8834"></A><B>Incomplete type.</B> An 
incomplete type gives a view of a type that reveals only some of its 
properties. The remaining properties are provided by the full view given 
elsewhere. Incomplete types can be used for defining recursive data structures.</div>
<div class="paranum">20.2/3</div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="I8835"></A><B>Indexable container type.</B> 
An indexable container type is one that has user-defined behavior for 
indexing, via the Constant_Indexing or Variable_Indexing aspects.</div>
<div class="paranum">21</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I8836"></A><B>Integer type.</B> Integer 
types comprise the signed integer types and the modular types. A signed 
integer type has a base range that includes both positive and negative 
numbers, and has operations that may raise an exception when the result 
is outside the base range. A modular type has a base range whose lower 
bound is zero, and has operations with &ldquo;wraparound&rdquo; semantics. 
Modular types subsume what are called &ldquo;unsigned types&rdquo; in 
some other languages.</div>
<div class="paranum">21.1/2</div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="I8837"></A><B>Interface type.</B> An 
interface type is a form of abstract tagged type which has no components 
or concrete operations except possibly null procedures. Interface types 
are used for composing other interfaces and tagged types and thereby 
provide multiple inheritance. Only an interface type can be used as a 
progenitor of another type.</div>
<div class="paranum">21.2/3</div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="I8838"></A><B>Invariant.</B> A invariant 
is an assertion that is expected to be True for all objects of a given 
private type when viewed from outside the defining package.</div>
<div class="paranum">21.3/3</div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="I8839"></A><B>Iterable container type.</B> 
An iterable container type is one that has user-defined behavior for 
iteration, via the Default_Iterator and Iterator_Element aspects.</div>
<div class="paranum">21.4/3</div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="I8840"></A><B>Iterator.</B> An iterator 
is a construct that is used to loop over the elements of an array or 
container. Iterators may be user defined, and may perform arbitrary computations 
to access elements from a container.</div>
<div class="paranum">22</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I8841"></A><B>Library unit.</B> A library 
unit is a separately compiled program unit, and is always a package, 
subprogram, or generic unit. Library units may have other (logically 
nested) library units as children, and may have other program units physically 
nested within them. <A NAME="I8842"></A>A root library unit, together 
with its children and grandchildren and so on, form a <I>subsystem</I>.</div>
<div class="paranum">23/2</div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;<A NAME="I8843"></A><B>Limited type.</B> A limited 
type is a type for which copying (such as in an <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="RM-5-2.html#S0152">assignment_statement</A></SPAN>) 
is not allowed. A nonlimited type is a type for which copying is allowed.</div>
<div class="paranum">24</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I8844"></A><B>Object.</B> An object is either 
a constant or a variable. An object contains a value. An object is created 
by an <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="RM-3-3-1.html#S0032">object_declaration</A></SPAN> 
or by an <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="RM-4-8.html#S0143">allocator</A></SPAN>. 
A formal parameter is (a view of) an object. A subcomponent of an object 
is an object.</div>
<div class="paranum">24.1/2</div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="I8845"></A><B>Overriding operation.</B> 
An overriding operation is one that replaces an inherited primitive operation. 
Operations may be marked explicitly as overriding or not overriding.</div>
<div class="paranum">25</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I8846"></A><B>Package.</B> Packages are 
program units that allow the specification of groups of logically related 
entities. Typically, a package contains the declaration of a type (often 
a private type or private extension) along with the declarations of primitive 
subprograms of the type, which can be called from outside the package, 
while their inner workings remain hidden from outside users.</div>
<div class="paranum">25.1/2</div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="I8847"></A><B>Parent.</B> The parent 
of a derived type is the first type given in the definition of the derived 
type. The parent can be almost any kind of type, including an interface 
type.</div>
<div class="paranum">26</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I8848"></A><B>Partition.</B> A <I>partition</I> 
is a part of a program. Each partition consists of a set of library units. 
Each partition may run in a separate address space, possibly on a separate 
computer. A program may contain just one partition. A distributed program 
typically contains multiple partitions, which can execute concurrently.</div>
<div class="paranum">26.1/3</div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="I8849"></A><B>Postcondition.</B> A postcondition 
is an assertion that is expected to be True when a given subprogram returns 
normally.</div>
<div class="paranum">27</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I8850"></A><B>Pragma.</B> A pragma is a 
compiler directive. There are language-defined pragmas that give instructions 
for optimization, listing control, etc. An implementation may support 
additional (implementation-defined) pragmas.</div>
<div class="paranum">27.1/3</div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="I8851"></A><B>Precondition.</B> A precondition 
is an assertion that is expected to be True when a given subprogram is 
called.</div>
<div class="paranum">27.2/3</div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="I8852"></A><B>Predicate.</B> A predicate 
is an assertion that is expected to be True for all objects of a given 
subtype.</div>
<div class="paranum">28</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I8853"></A><B>Primitive operations.</B> 
The primitive operations of a type are the operations (such as subprograms) 
declared together with the type declaration. They are inherited by other 
types in the same class of types. For a tagged type, the primitive subprograms 
are dispatching subprograms, providing run-time polymorphism. A dispatching 
subprogram may be called with statically tagged operands, in which case 
the subprogram body invoked is determined at compile time. Alternatively, 
a dispatching subprogram may be called using a dispatching call, in which 
case the subprogram body invoked is determined at run time.</div>
<div class="paranum">29/2</div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;<A NAME="I8854"></A><B>Private extension.</B> A 
private extension is a type that extends another type, with the additional 
properties hidden from its clients.</div>
<div class="paranum">30/2</div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;<A NAME="I8855"></A><B>Private type.</B> A private 
type gives a view of a type that reveals only some of its properties. 
The remaining properties are provided by the full view given elsewhere. 
Private types can be used for defining abstractions that hide unnecessary 
details from their clients.</div>
<div class="paranum">30.1/2</div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="I8856"></A><B>Procedure.</B> A procedure 
is a form of subprogram that does not return a result and can only be 
called by a <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="RM-5-1.html#S0146">statement</A></SPAN>.</div>
<div class="paranum">30.2/2</div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="I8857"></A><B>Progenitor.</B> A progenitor 
of a derived type is one of the types given in the definition of the 
derived type other than the first. A progenitor is always an interface 
type. Interfaces, tasks, and protected types may also have progenitors.</div>
<div class="paranum">31</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I8858"></A><B>Program.</B> A <I>program</I> 
is a set of <I>partitions</I>, each of which may execute in a separate 
address space, possibly on a separate computer. A partition consists 
of a set of library units.</div>
<div class="paranum">32</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I8859"></A><B>Program unit.</B> A <I>program 
unit</I> is either a package, a task unit, a protected unit, a protected 
entry, a generic unit, or an explicitly declared subprogram other than 
an enumeration literal. Certain kinds of program units can be separately 
compiled. Alternatively, they can appear physically nested within other 
program units.</div>
<div class="paranum">33/2</div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;<A NAME="I8860"></A><B>Protected type.</B> A protected 
type is a composite type whose components are accessible only through 
one of its protected operations which synchronize concurrent access by 
multiple tasks.</div>
<div class="paranum">34</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I8861"></A><B>Real type.</B> A real type 
has values that are approximations of the real numbers. Floating point 
and fixed point types are real types.</div>
<div class="paranum">35</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I8862"></A><B>Record extension.</B> A record 
extension is a type that extends another type by adding additional components.</div>
<div class="paranum">36</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I8863"></A><B>Record type.</B> A record 
type is a composite type consisting of zero or more named components, 
possibly of different types.</div>
<div class="paranum">36.1/3</div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="I8864"></A><B>Reference type.</B> A reference 
type is one that has user-defined behavior for &ldquo;.<B>all</B>&rdquo;, 
defined by the Implicit_Dereference aspect.</div>
<div class="paranum">36.2/2</div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="I8865"></A><B>Renaming.</B> A <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="RM-8-5.html#S0199">renaming_declaration</A></SPAN> 
is a declaration that does not define a new entity, but instead defines 
a view of an existing entity.</div>
<div class="paranum">37</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I8866"></A><B>Scalar type.</B> A scalar 
type is either a discrete type or a real type.</div>
<div class="paranum">37.1/3</div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="I8867"></A><B>Storage pool.</B> Each 
access-to-object type has an associated storage pool object. The storage 
for an object created by an <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="RM-4-8.html#S0143">allocator</A></SPAN> 
comes from the storage pool of the type of the <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="RM-4-8.html#S0143">allocator</A></SPAN>. 
Some storage pools may be partitioned into subpools in order to support 
finer-grained storage management.</div>
<div class="paranum">37.2/3</div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="I8868"></A><B>Stream.</B> A stream is 
a sequence of elements that can be used, along with the stream-oriented 
attributes, to support marshalling and unmarshalling of values of most 
types.</div>
<div class="paranum">37.3/2</div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="I8869"></A><B>Subprogram.</B> A subprogram 
is a section of a program that can be executed in various contexts. It 
is invoked by a subprogram call that may qualify the effect of the subprogram 
through the passing of parameters. There are two forms of subprograms: 
functions, which return values, and procedures, which do not.</div>
<div class="paranum">38/3</div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;<A NAME="I8870"></A><B>Subtype.</B> A subtype is 
a type together with optional constraints, null exclusions, and predicates, 
which constrain the values of the subtype to satisfy certain conditions. 
The values of a subtype are a subset of the values of its type.</div>
<div class="paranum">38.1/2</div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A NAME="I8871"></A><B>Synchronized.</B> A synchronized 
entity is one that will work safely with multiple tasks at one time. 
A synchronized interface can be an ancestor of a task or a protected 
type. Such a task or protected type is called a synchronized tagged type.</div>
<div class="paranum">39</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I8872"></A><B>Tagged type.</B> The objects 
of a tagged type have a run-time type tag, which indicates the specific 
type with which the object was originally created. An operand of a class-wide 
tagged type can be used in a dispatching call; the tag indicates which 
subprogram body to invoke. Nondispatching calls, in which the subprogram 
body to invoke is determined at compile time, are also allowed. Tagged 
types may be extended with additional components.</div>
<div class="paranum">40/2</div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;<A NAME="I8873"></A><B>Task type.</B> A task type 
is a composite type used to represent active entities which execute concurrently 
and which can communicate via queued task entries. The top-level task 
of a partition is called the environment task.</div>
<div class="paranum">41/2</div>
<div class="Normal">&nbsp;<A NAME="I8874"></A><B>Type.</B> Each object has 
a type. A <I>type</I> has an associated set of values, and a set of <I>primitive
