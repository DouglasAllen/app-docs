Entities</A>&rdquo;</div>
<div class="paranum">23.a</div>
<div class="Annotations"><B>Discussion:&nbsp;</B>The idea of the Specialized 
Needs Annexes is that implementations can choose to target certain application 
areas. For example, an implementation specifically targeted to embedded 
machines might support the application-specific features for Real-time 
Systems, but not the application-specific features for Information Systems.</div>
<div class="paranum">23.b</div>
<div class="Annotations">The Specialized Needs Annexes extend the core 
language only in ways that users, implementations, and standards bodies 
are allowed to extend the language; for example, via additional library 
units, attributes, representation items (see <A HREF="AA-13-1.html">13.1</A>), 
<SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="AA-2-8.html#S0019">pragma</A></SPAN>s, and 
constraints on semantic details that are left unspecified by the core 
language. Many implementations already provide much of the functionality 
defined by Specialized Needs Annexes; our goal is to increase uniformity 
among implementations by defining standard ways of providing the functionality.</div>
<div class="paranum">23.c/2</div>
<div class="Annotations">{<I><A HREF="http://www.ada-auth.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/AIs/AI-00114.TXT">AI95-00114-01</A></I>} 
We recommend that the certification procedures allow implementations 
to certify the core language, plus any set of the Specialized Needs Annexes. 
We recommend that implementations <I>not</I> be allowed to certify a 
portion of one of the Specialized Needs Annexes, although implementations 
can, of course, provide uncertified support for such portions. We have 
designed the Specialized Needs Annexes assuming that this recommendation 
is followed. Thus, our decisions about what to include and what not to 
include in those annexes are based on the assumption that each annex 
is certified in an &ldquo;all-or-nothing&rdquo; manner.</div>
<div class="paranum">23.d</div>
<div class="Annotations">An implementation may, of course, support extensions 
that are different from (but possibly related to) those defined by one 
of the Specialized Needs Annexes. We recommend that, where appropriate, 
implementations do this by adding library units that are children of 
existing language-defined library packages.</div>
<div class="paranum">23.e</div>
<div class="Annotations">An implementation should not provide extensions 
that conflict with those defined in the Specialized Needs Annexes, in 
the following sense: Suppose an implementation supports a certain error-free 
program that uses only functionality defined in the core and in the Specialized 
Needs Annexes. The implementation should ensure that that program will 
still be error free in some possible full implementation of all of the 
Specialized Needs Annexes, and that the semantics of the program will 
not change. For example, an implementation should not provide a package 
with the same name as one defined in one of the Specialized Needs Annexes, 
but that behaves differently, <I>even if that implementation does not 
claim conformance to that Annex</I>.</div>
<div class="paranum">23.f</div>
<div class="Annotations">Note that the Specialized Needs Annexes do not 
conflict with each other; it is the intent that a single implementation 
can conform to all of them.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="paranum">24</div>
<div class="WideAbove">Each section is divided into clauses and subclauses 
that have a common structure. Each section, clause, and subclause first 
introduces its subject. After the introductory text, text is labeled 
with the following headings:&nbsp;</div>

<H4 Class="centered">Language Design Principles</H4>
<div class="paranum">24.a</div>
<div class="Annotations">These are not rules of the language, but guiding 
principles or goals used in defining the rules of the language. In some 
cases, the goal is only partially met; such cases are explained.</div>
<div class="paranum">24.b/3</div>
<div class="Annotations">{<I><A HREF="http://www.ada-auth.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/AI05s/AI05-0005-1.TXT">AI05-0005-1</A></I>} 
This is not part of the definition of the language, and does not appear 
in the Ada 2012 RM.&nbsp;</div>

<H4 Class="centered">Syntax</H4>
<div class="paranum">25</div>
<div class="Indented1"><A NAME="I1013"></A><A NAME="I1014"></A><A NAME="I1015"></A><A NAME="I1016"></A><A NAME="I1017"></A>Syntax 
rules (indented).&nbsp;</div>

<H4 Class="centered">Name Resolution Rules</H4>
<div class="paranum">26</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I1018"></A><A NAME="I1019"></A><A NAME="I1020"></A>Compile-time 
rules that are used in name resolution, including overload resolution. 
</div>
<div class="paranum">26.a</div>
<div class="Annotations"><B>Discussion:&nbsp;</B>These rules are observed 
at compile time. (We say &ldquo;observed&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;checked,&rdquo; 
because these rules are not individually checked. They are really just 
part of the Legality Rules in Section 8 that require exactly one interpretation 
of each constituent of a complete context.) The only rules used in overload 
resolution are the Syntax Rules and the Name Resolution Rules.</div>
<div class="paranum">26.b</div>
<div class="Annotations">When dealing with nonoverloadable declarations 
it sometimes makes no semantic difference whether a given rule is a Name 
Resolution Rule or a Legality Rule, and it is sometimes difficult to 
decide which it should be. We generally make a given rule a Name Resolution 
Rule only if it has to be. For example, &ldquo;The <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="AA-4-1.html#S0091">name</A></SPAN>, 
if any, in a <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="AA-11-3.html#S0269">raise_statement</A></SPAN> 
shall be the <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="AA-4-1.html#S0091">name</A></SPAN> 
of an exception.&rdquo; is under &ldquo;Legality Rules.&rdquo;&nbsp;</div>

<H4 Class="centered">Legality Rules</H4>
<div class="paranum">27</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I1021"></A><A NAME="I1022"></A><A NAME="I1023"></A>Rules 
that are enforced at compile time. <A NAME="I1024"></A><A NAME="I1025"></A>A 
construct is <I>legal</I> if it obeys all of the Legality Rules.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="paranum">27.a</div>
<div class="Annotations"><B>Discussion:&nbsp;</B>These rules are not used 
in overload resolution.</div>
<div class="paranum">27.b</div>
<div class="Annotations">Note that run-time errors are always attached 
to exceptions; for example, it is not &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; to divide 
by zero, it just raises an exception.&nbsp;</div>

<H4 Class="centered">Static Semantics</H4>
<div class="paranum">28</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I1026"></A><A NAME="I1027"></A>A definition 
of the compile-time effect of each construct.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="paranum">28.a</div>
<div class="Annotations"><B>Discussion:&nbsp;</B>The most important compile-time 
effects represent the effects on the symbol table associated with declarations 
(implicit or explicit). In addition, we use this heading as a bit of 
a grab bag for equivalences, package specifications, etc. For example, 
this is where we put statements like so-and-so is equivalent to such-and-such. 
(We ought to try to really mean it when we say such things!) Similarly, 
statements about magically-generated implicit declarations go here. These 
rules are generally written as statements of fact about the semantics, 
rather than as a you-shall-do-such-and-such sort of thing.&nbsp;</div>

<H4 Class="centered">Post-Compilation Rules</H4>
<div class="paranum">29</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I1028"></A><A NAME="I1029"></A><A NAME="I1030"></A><A NAME="I1031"></A>Rules 
that are enforced before running a partition. <A NAME="I1032"></A><A NAME="I1033"></A>A 
partition is legal if its compilation units are legal and it obeys all 
of the Post-Compilation Rules.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="paranum">29.a</div>
<div class="Annotations"><B>Discussion:&nbsp;</B>It is not specified exactly 
when these rules are checked, so long as they are checked for any given 
partition before that partition starts running. An implementation may 
choose to check some such rules at compile time, and reject <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="AA-10-1-1.html#S0247">compilation_unit</A></SPAN>s 
accordingly. Alternatively, an implementation may check such rules when 
the partition is created (usually known as &ldquo;link time&rdquo;), 
or when the partition is mapped to a particular piece of hardware (but 
before the partition starts running).&nbsp;</div>

<H4 Class="centered">Dynamic Semantics</H4>
<div class="paranum">30</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I1034"></A><A NAME="I1035"></A><A NAME="I1036"></A><A NAME="I1037"></A>A 
definition of the run-time effect of each construct.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="paranum">30.a</div>
<div class="Annotations"><B>Discussion:&nbsp;</B>This heading describes what 
happens at run time. Run-time checks, which raise exceptions upon failure, 
are described here. Each item that involves a run-time check is marked 
with the name of the check &mdash; these are the same check names that 
are used in a <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="AA-2-8.html#S0019">pragma</A></SPAN> 
Suppress. Principle: Every check should have a name, usable in a <SPAN Class="swiss"><A HREF="AA-2-8.html#S0019">pragma</A></SPAN> 
Suppress.&nbsp;</div>

<H4 Class="centered">Bounded (Run-Time) Errors</H4>
<div class="paranum">31</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I1038"></A><A NAME="I1039"></A>Situations 
that result in bounded (run-time) errors (see <A HREF="AA-1-1-5.html">1.1.5</A>). 
</div>
<div class="paranum">31.a</div>
<div class="Annotations"><B>Discussion:&nbsp;</B>The &ldquo;bounds&rdquo; 
of each such error are described here &mdash; that is, we characterize 
the set of all possible behaviors that can result from a bounded error 
occurring at run time.&nbsp;</div>

<H4 Class="centered">Erroneous Execution</H4>
<div class="paranum">32</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I1040"></A><A NAME="I1041"></A>Situations 
that result in erroneous execution (see <A HREF="AA-1-1-5.html">1.1.5</A>).

<H4 Class="centered">Implementation Requirements</H4>
<div class="paranum">33</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I1042"></A>Additional requirements for conforming 
implementations.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="paranum">33.a</div>
<div class="Annotations"><B>Discussion:&nbsp;</B>...as opposed to rules imposed 
on the programmer. An example might be, &ldquo;The smallest representable 
duration, Duration'Small, shall not be greater than twenty milliseconds.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="paranum">33.b</div>
<div class="Annotations">It's really just an issue of how the rule is 
worded. We could write the same rule as &ldquo;The smallest representable 
duration is an implementation-defined value less than or equal to 20 
milliseconds&rdquo; and then it would be under &ldquo;Static Semantics.&rdquo; 
</div>

<H4 Class="centered">Documentation Requirements</H4>
<div class="paranum">34</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I1043"></A>Documentation requirements for 
conforming implementations.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="paranum">34.a</div>
<div class="Annotations"><B>Discussion:&nbsp;</B>These requirements are beyond 
those that are implicitly specified by the phrase &ldquo;implementation 
defined&rdquo;. The latter require documentation as well, but we don't 
repeat these cases under this heading. Usually this heading is used for 
when the description of the documentation requirement is longer and does 
not correspond directly to one, narrow normative sentence.&nbsp;</div>

<H4 Class="centered">Metrics</H4>
<div class="paranum">35</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I1044"></A>Metrics that are specified for 
the time/space properties of the execution of certain language constructs.

<H4 Class="centered">Implementation Permissions</H4>
<div class="paranum">36</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I1045"></A>Additional permissions given 
to the implementer.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="paranum">36.a</div>
<div class="Annotations"><B>Discussion:&nbsp;</B>For example, &ldquo;The implementation 
is allowed to impose further restrictions on the record aggregates allowed 
in code statements.&rdquo; When there are restrictions on the permission, 
those restrictions are given here also. For example, &ldquo;An implementation 
is allowed to restrict the kinds of subprograms that are allowed to be 
main subprograms. However, it shall support at least parameterless procedures.&rdquo; 
&mdash; we don't split this up between here and &ldquo;Implementation 
Requirements.&rdquo;&nbsp;</div>

<H4 Class="centered">Implementation Advice</H4>
<div class="paranum">37</div>
<div class="Normal"><A NAME="I1046"></A><A NAME="I1047"></A>Optional 
advice given to the implementer. The word &ldquo;should&rdquo; is used 
to indicate that the advice is a recommendation, not a requirement. It 
is implementation defined whether or not a given recommendation is obeyed. 
</div>
<div class="paranum">37.a/2</div>
<div class="Annotations"><B>Implementation defined:&nbsp;</B>Whether or not 
each recommendation given in Implementation Advice is followed &mdash; 
see <A HREF="AA-M-3.html">M.3</A>, &ldquo;<A HREF="AA-M-3.html">Implementation 
Advice</A>&rdquo; for a listing.</div>
<div class="paranum">37.b/1</div>
<div class="Annotations"><B>Discussion:&nbsp;</B>The advice generally shows 
the intended implementation, but the implementer is free to ignore it. 
The implementer is the sole arbiter of whether or not the advice has 
been obeyed, if not, whether the reason is a good one, and whether the 
required documentation is sufficient. It would be wrong for the ACATS 
to enforce any of this advice.</div>
<div class="paranum">37.c</div>
<div class="Annotations">For example, &ldquo;Whenever possible, the implementation 
should choose a value no greater than fifty microseconds for the smallest 
representable duration, Duration'Small.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="paranum">37.d</div>
<div class="Annotations">We use this heading, for example, when the rule 
is so low level or implementation-oriented as to be untestable. We also 
use this heading when we wish to encourage implementations to behave 
in a certain way in most cases, but we do not wish to burden implementations 
by requiring the behavior.&nbsp;</div>

The next three headings list all language changes between Ada 83 and 
Ada 95. Language changes are any change that changes the set of text 
strings that are legal Ada programs, or changes the meaning of any legal 
program. Wording changes, such as changes in terminology, are not language 
changes. Each language change falls into one of the following three categories: 
</div>

<H4 Class="centered">Inconsistencies With Ada 83</H4>
<div class="paranum">39.b</div>
<div class="Annotations"><A NAME="I1049"></A>This heading lists all of 
the upward inconsistencies between Ada 83 and Ada 95. Upward inconsistencies 
are situations in which a legal Ada 83 program is a legal Ada 95 program 
with different semantics. This type of upward incompatibility is the 
worst type for users, so we only tolerate it in rare situations.</div>
<div class="paranum">39.c</div>
<div class="Annotations">(Note that the semantics of a program is not 
the same thing as the behavior of the program. Because of Ada's indeterminacy, 
the &ldquo;semantics&rdquo; of a given feature describes a <I>set</I> 
of behaviors that can be exhibited by that feature. The set can contain 
more than one allowed behavior. Thus, when we ask whether the semantics 
changes, we are asking whether the set of behaviors changes.)</div>

The next three headings list all language changes between Ada 95 and 
Ada 2005 (the language defined by the Ada 95 standard plus Technical 
Corrigendum 1 plus Amendment 1). Each language change falls into one 
of the following three categories:&nbsp;</div>

<H4 Class="centered">Inconsistencies With Ada 95</H4>
<div class="paranum">39.m/2</div>
<div class="Annotations"><A NAME="I1053"></A>This heading lists all of 
the upward inconsistencies between Ada 95 and Ada 2005. Upward inconsistencies 
are situations in which a legal Ada 95 program is a legal Ada 2005 program 
with different semantics.</div>

Inconsistencies marked with <B>Corrigendum:</B><A NAME="I1054"></A> are 
corrections to the original Ada 95 definition introduced by Corrigendum 
1. Inconsistencies marked with <B>Amendment Correction:</B><A NAME="I1055"></A> 
are corrections to the original Ada 95 definition added by Amendment 
1. Formally, these are inconsistencies caused by Ada Issues classified 
as Binding Interpretations; implementations of Ada 95 are supposed to 
follow these corrections, not the original flawed language definition. 
Thus, these strictly speaking are not inconsistencies between Ada 95 
and Ada 2005. Practically, however, they very well may be, as early Ada 
95 implementations might not follow the recommendation. Inconsistencies 
so marked are not portable between Ada 95 implementations, while usually 
Ada 2005 will have more clearly defined behavior. Therefore, we document 
these for completeness.</div>

As with inconsistencies, incompatibilities marked with <B>Corrigendum:</B>
