aolserver4-nsopenssl for Debian
-------------------------------

In order to use this module you need to add some stuff to your nsd configuration files
(eg the default one is /etc/aolserver4/aolserver4.tcl).

You can find an easy nsd.tcl in the examples directory. You will need also to provide 
an openssl keypair to have a working configuration.
