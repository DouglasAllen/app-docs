                    Summary of Documentation Requirements


1/2 {documentation requirements} The Ada language allows for certain target
machine dependences in a controlled manner. Each Ada implementation must
document many characteristics and properties of the target system. This
International Standard contains specific documentation requirements. In
addition, many characteristics that require documentation are identified
throughout this International Standard as being implementation defined.
Finally, this International Standard requires documentation of whether
implementation advice is followed. The following clauses provide summaries of
these documentation requirements.

M.3 Implementation Advice


1/2 {implementation advice (summary of advice)}
{documentation (required of an implementation)} This International Standard
sometimes gives advice about handling certain target machine dependences. Each
Ada implementation must document whether that advice is followed:

1.a/2       Ramification: Some of the items in this list require documentation
            only for implementations that conform to Specialized Needs
            Annexes.

2/2   * Program_Error should be raised when an unsupported Specialized Needs
        Annex feature is used at run time. See 1.1.3(20).

3/2   * Implementation-defined extensions to the functionality of a
        language-defined library unit should be provided by adding children to
        the library unit. See 1.1.3(21).

4/2   * If a bounded error or erroneous execution is detected, Program_Error
        should be raised. See 1.1.5(12).

5/2   * Implementation-defined pragmas should have no semantic effect for
        error-free programs. See 2.8(16).

6/2   * Implementation-defined pragmas should not make an illegal program
        legal, unless they complete a declaration or configure the
        library_items in an environment. See 2.8(19).

7/2   * Long_Integer should be declared in Standard if the target supports
        32-bit arithmetic. No other named integer subtypes should be declared
        in Standard. See 3.5.4(28).

8/2   * For a two's complement target, modular types with a binary modulus up
        to System.Max_Int*2+2 should be supported. A nonbinary modulus up to
        Integer'Last should be supported. See 3.5.4(29).

9/2   * Program_Error should be raised for the evaluation of S'Pos for an
        enumeration type, if the value of the operand does not correspond to
        the internal code for any enumeration literal of the type. See 3.5.5
        (8).

10/2   * Long_Float should be declared in Standard if the target supports 11
        or more digits of precision. No other named float subtypes should be
        declared in Standard. See 3.5.7(17).

11/2   * Multidimensional arrays should be represented in row-major order,
        unless the array has convention Fortran. See 3.6.2(11).

12/2   * Tags.Internal_Tag should return the tag of a type whose innermost
        master is the master of the point of the function call.. See 3.9
        (26.1/2).

13/2   * For a real static expression with a non-formal type that is not part
        of a larger static expression should be rounded the same as the target
        system. See 4.9(38.1/2).

14/2   * The value of Duration'Small should be no greater than 100
        microseconds. See 9.6(30).

15/2   * The time base for delay_relative_statements should be monotonic. See
        9.6(31).

16/2   * Leap seconds should be supported if the target system supports them.
        Otherwise, operations in Calendar.Formatting should return results
        consistent with no leap seconds. See 9.6.1(89/2).

17/2   * When applied to a generic unit, a program unit pragma that is not a
        library unit pragma should apply to each instance of the generic unit
        for which there is not an overriding pragma applied directly to the
        instance. See 10.1.5(10/1).

18/2   * A type declared in a preelaborated package should have the same
        representation in every elaboration of a given version of the package.
        See 10.2.1(12).

19/2   * Exception_Information should provide information useful for
        debugging, and should include the Exception_Name and
        Exception_Message. See 11.4.1(19).

20/2   * Exception_Message by default should be short, provide information
        useful for debugging, and should not include the Exception_Name. See
        11.4.1(19).

21/2   * Code executed for checks that have been suppressed should be
        minimized. See 11.5(28).

22/2   * The recommended level of support for all representation items should
        be followed. See 13.1(28/2).

23/2   * Storage allocated to objects of a packed type should be minimized.
        See 13.2(6).

24/2   * The recommended level of support for pragma Pack should be followed.
        See 13.2(9).

25/2   * For an array X, X'Address should point at the first component of the
        array rather than the array bounds. See 13.3(14).

26/2   * The recommended level of support for the Address attribute should be
        followed. See 13.3(19).

27/2   * The recommended level of support for the Alignment attribute should
        be followed. See 13.3(35).

28/2   * The Size of an array object should not include its bounds. See 13.3
        (41.1/2).

29/2   * If the Size of a subtype allows for efficient independent
        addressability, then the Size of most objects of the subtype should
        equal the Size of the subtype. See 13.3(52).

30/2   * A Size clause on a composite subtype should not affect the internal
        layout of components. See 13.3(53).

31/2   * The recommended level of support for the Size attribute should be
        followed. See 13.3(56).

32/2   * The recommended level of support for the Component_Size attribute
        should be followed. See 13.3(73).

33/2   * The recommended level of support for
        enumeration_representation_clauses should be followed. See 13.4(10).

34/2   * The recommended level of support for record_representation_clauses
        should be followed. See 13.5.1(22).

35/2   * If a component is represented using a pointer to the actual data of
        the component which is contiguous with the rest of the object, then
        the storage place attributes should reflect the place of the actual
        data. If a component is allocated discontiguously from the rest of the
        object, then a warning should be generated upon reference to one of
        its storage place attributes. See 13.5.2(5).

36/2   * The recommended level of support for the nondefault bit ordering
        should be followed. See 13.5.3(8).

37/2   * Type System.Address should be a private type. See 13.7(37).

38/2   * Operations in System and its children should reflect the target
        environment; operations that do not make sense should raise
        Program_Error. See 13.7.1(16).

39/2   * Since the Size of an array object generally does not include its
        bounds, the bounds should not be part of the converted data in an
        instance of Unchecked_Conversion. See 13.9(14/2).

40/2   * There should not be unnecessary run-time checks on the result of an
        Unchecked_Conversion; the result should be returned by reference when
        possible. Restrictions on Unchecked_Conversions should be avoided. See
        13.9(15).

41/2   * The recommended level of support for Unchecked_Conversion should be
        followed. See 13.9(17).

42/2   * Any cases in which heap storage is dynamically allocated other than
        as part of the evaluation of an allocator should be documented. See
        13.11(23).

43/2   * A default storage pool for an access-to-constant type should not have
        overhead to support deallocation of individual objects. See 13.11(24).

44/2   * Usually, a storage pool for an access discriminant or access
        parameter should be created at the point of an allocator, and be
        reclaimed when the designated object becomes inaccessible. For other
        anonymous access types, the pool should be created at the point where
        the type is elaborated and need not support deallocation of individual
        objects. See 13.11(25).

45/2   * For a standard storage pool, an instance of Unchecked_Deallocation
        should actually reclaim the storage. See 13.11.2(17).

46/2   * If not specified, the value of Stream_Size for an elementary type
        should be the number of bits that corresponds to the minimum number of
        stream elements required by the first subtype of the type, rounded up
        to the nearest factor or multiple of the word size that is also a
        multiple of the stream element size. See 13.13.2(1.6/2).

47/2   * The recommended level of support for the Stream_Size attribute should
        be followed. See 13.13.2(1.8/2).

48/2   * If an implementation provides additional named predefined integer
        types, then the names should end with "Integer". If an implementation
        provides additional named predefined floating point types, then the
        names should end with "Float". See A.1(52).

49/2   * Implementation-defined operations on Wide_Character, Wide_String,
        Wide_Wide_Character, and Wide_Wide_String should be child units of
        Wide_Characters or Wide_Wide_Characters. See A.3.1(7/2).

50/2   * Bounded string objects should not be implemented by implicit pointers
        and dynamic allocation. See A.4.4(106).

51/2   * Strings.Hash should be good a hash function, returning a wide spread
        of values for different string values, and similar strings should
        rarely return the same value. See A.4.9(12/2).

52/2   * Any storage associated with an object of type Generator of the random
        number packages should be reclaimed on exit from the scope of the
        object. See A.5.2(46).

53/2   * Each value of Initiator passed to Reset for the random number
        packages should initiate a distinct sequence of random numbers, or, if
        that is not possible, be at least a rapidly varying function of the
        initiator value. See A.5.2(47).

54/2   * Get_Immediate should be implemented with unbuffered input; input
        should be available immediately; line-editing should be disabled. See
        A.10.7(23).

55/2   * Package Directories.Information should be provided to retrieve other
        information about a file. See A.16(124/2).

56/2   * Directories.Start_Search and Directories.Search should raise
        Use_Error for malformed patterns. See A.16(125/2).

57/2   * Directories.Rename should be supported at least when both New_Name
        and Old_Name are simple names and New_Name does not identify an
        existing external file. See A.16(126/2).

58/2   * If the execution environment supports subprocesses, the current
        environment variables should be used to initialize the environment
        variables of a subprocess. See A.17(32/2).

59/2   * Changes to the environment variables made outside the control of
        Environment_Variables should be reflected immediately. See A.17(33/2).

        by the operation. See A.18.3(163/2).

72/2   * Move for a map should not copy elements, and should minimize copying
        of internal data structures. See A.18.4(83/2).

73/2   * If an exception is propagated from a map operation, no storage should
        be lost, nor any elements removed from a map unless specified by the

        machine-code subprograms. See C.1(10).

        more efficient implementation. See D.7(21).

110/2   * When appropriate, mechanisms to change the value of Tick should be
        provided. See D.8(47).

111/2   * Calendar.Clock and Real_Time.Clock should be transformations of the
        same time base. See D.8(48).

112/2   * The "best" time base which exists in the underlying system should be
        available to the application through Real_Time.Clock. See D.8(49).

113/2   * When appropriate, implementations should provide configuration
        mechanisms to change the value of Execution_Time.CPU_Tick. See D.14
        (29/2).

114/2   * For a timing event, the handler should be executed directly by the
        real-time clock interrupt mechanism. See D.15(25).

115/2   * The PCS should allow for multiple tasks to call the RPC-receiver.
        See E.5(28).

        out of space when writing an item. See E.5(29).

123/2   * For elementary functions, the forward trigonometric functions
        without a Cycle parameter should not be implemented by calling the
