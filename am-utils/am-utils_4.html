<p>The <i>Amd</i> package has been without an official maintainer since 1992.
Several people have stepped in to maintain it unofficially.  Most
notable were the &lsquo;upl&rsquo; (Unofficial Patch Level) releases of <i>Amd</i>,
created by me (<a href="http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~ezk">Erez Zadok</a>), and available from
<a href="ftp://ftp.am-utils.org/pub/amd/">ftp://ftp.am-utils.org/pub/amd/</a>.  The last such unofficial
release was &lsquo;upl102&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>Through the process of patching and aging, it was becoming more and more
apparent that <i>Amd</i> was in much need of revitalizing.  Maintaining
<i>Amd</i> had become a difficult task.  I took it upon myself to cleanup
the code, so that it would be easier to port to new platforms, add new
features, keep up with the many new feature requests, and deal with the
never ending stream of bug reports.
</p>
<p>I have been working on such a release of <i>Amd</i> on and off since
January of 1996.  The new suite of tools is currently named &quot;am-utils&quot;
(AutoMounter Utilities), in line with GNU naming conventions, befitting
the contents of the package.  In October of 1996 I had received enough
offers to help me with this task that I decided to make a mailing list
for this group of people.  Around the same time, <i>Amd</i> had become a
necessary part of my PhD thesis work, resulting in more work performed
on am-utils.
</p>
<p>Am-utils version 6.0 was numbered with a major new release number to
distinguish it from the last official release of <i>Amd</i> (5.x).  Many
new features have been added such as a GNU <code>configure</code> system, NFS
Version 3, a run-time configuration file (&lsquo;amd.conf&rsquo;), many new ports,
more scripts and programs, as well as numerous bug fixes.  Another
reason for the new major release number was to alert users of am-utils
that user-visible interfaces may have changed.  In order to make <i>Amd</i>
work well for the next 10 years, and be easier to maintain, it was
necessary to remove old or unused features, change various syntax files,
etc.  However, great care was taken to ensure the maximum possible
backwards compatibility.
</p>
<p>Am-utils version 6.1 has autofs support for Linux and Solaris 2.5+ as
<i>the</i> major new feature, in addition to several other minor new
features.  The autofs support is completely transparent to the
end-user, aside from the fact that <code>/bin/pwd</code> now always returns
the correct amd-ified path.  The administrator can easily switch
between NFS and autofs mounts by changing one parameter in
<code>amd.conf</code>.  Autofs support and maintenance was developed in
conjunction with <a href="mailto:ionut AT badula.org">Ion Badulescu</a>.
