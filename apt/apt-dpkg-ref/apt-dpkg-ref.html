<H3>Common APT usage</H3>
<B>apt-get install &lt;package&gt;</B>

Downloads &lt;package&gt; and all of its dependencies, and installs or upgrades them. This will also take a package off of <I>hold</I> if it was put on. See below for more info on <I>hold.</I><BR><BR>

<B>apt-get remove [--purge] &lt;package&gt;</B>

Removes &lt;package&gt; and any packages that depend on it.  --purge specifies that packages should be <I>purged</I>, see <FONT FACE="FIXED">dpkg -P</FONT> for more information.<BR><BR>

<B>apt-get update</B>

Updates packages listings from Debian mirrors, should be run at least once a day if you install anything that day, and every time after <FONT FACE="Helvetica">/etc/apt/sources.list</FONT> is changed.<BR><BR>

<B>apt-get upgrade [-u]</B>

Upgrades all packages installed to newest versions available. Will not install new or remove old packages. If a package changes dependencies and requires installation of a new package, it will not be upgraded, it will be put on <I>hold</I> instead. <FONT FACE="FIXED">apt-get upgrade</FONT> will not upgrade packages put on <I>hold</I> (that is the meaning of <I>hold</I>). See below for how to manually put packages on <I>hold</I>. I suggest the `-u' option as well, because then you can see what packages are going to be upgraded.<BR><BR>

<B>apt-get dist-upgrade [-u]</B>

Similar to <FONT FACE="FIXED">apt-get upgrade</FONT>, except that <I>dist-upgrade</I> will install or remove packages to satisfy dependencies.<BR><BR>

<B>apt-cache search &lt;pattern&gt;</B>

Searches packages and descriptions for &lt;pattern&gt;.<BR><BR>

<B>apt-cache show &lt;package&gt;</B>

Shows the full description of &lt;package&gt;.<BR><BR>

<B>apt-cache showpkg &lt;package&gt;</B>

Shows a lot more detail about &lt;package&gt;, and its relationships to other packages.<BR><BR>

<B>synaptic <BR> gdebi <BR> gdebi-kde <BR> dselect <BR> aptitude <BR> gnome-apt</B>

Graphical front ends to <I>APT</I> (some of these may be in their own package, that must be installed before use). While <FONT FACE="FIXED">dselect</FONT> is arguably the most powerful, it's also the oldest and hardest to use.<BR><BR>



<H3>Common Dpkg usage</H3>
<B>dpkg -i &lt;package.deb&gt;</B>

Installs a Debian package file; one that you downloaded manually, for example.<BR><BR>

<B>dpkg -c &lt;package.deb&gt;</B>

Lists the contents of &lt;package.deb&gt;, a .deb file.<BR><BR>

<B>dpkg -I &lt;package.deb&gt;</B>

Extracts package information from &lt;package.deb&gt;, a .deb file.<BR><BR>

<B>dpkg -r &lt;package&gt;</B>

Removes an installed package named &lt;package&gt;<BR><BR>

<B>dpkg -P &lt;package&gt;</B>

Purges an installed package named &lt;package&gt;.  The difference between <I>remove</I> and <I>purge</I> is that while <I>remove</I> only deletes data and executables, <I>purge</I> also deletes all configuration files in addition.<BR><BR>

<B>dpkg -L &lt;package&gt;</B>

Gives a listing of all the files installed by &lt;package&gt;.  See also <FONT FACE="FIXED">dpkg -c</FONT> for checking the contents of a .deb file.<BR><BR>

<B>dpkg -s &lt;package&gt;</B>

Shows information on the installed package &lt;package&gt;.  See also <FONT FACE="FIXED">apt-cache show</FONT> for viewing package information in the Debian archive and <FONT FACE="FIXED">dpkg -I</FONT> for viewing package information extracted from a .deb file.<BR><BR>

<B>dpkg-reconfigure &lt;package&gt;</B>

Reconfigures an installed package, if it uses <I>debconf</I> (<I>debconf</I> provides that consistent configuration interface for package installation).  You can reconfigure <I>debconf</I> itself if you want to change the front-end or priority of questions asked. For example, to reconfigure <I>debconf</I> with the dialog front-end, you simply run: 
<P><CENTER><CODE>dpkg-reconfigure --frontend=dialog debconf</CODE></CENTER></P>
<BR><BR>

<B>echo ``&lt;package&gt; hold'' | dpkg --set-selections</B>

Put &lt;package&gt; on <I>hold</I> (command line method)<BR><BR>

<B>dpkg --get-selections ``&lt;package&gt;''</B>

Get the current status of &lt;package&gt; (command line method)<BR><BR>

<B>dpkg -S &lt;file&gt;</B>

Searches for &lt;file&gt; in package database, telling you which installed packages have that file in them. To search for a file or list the contents of a package without installing it, you can use apt-file command line tool.<BR><BR>



<H3>Building Debian packages from Source</H3>
<B>apt-get source [-b] &lt;package&gt;</B>

Download the source Debian package for &lt;package&gt; and extract it. You must have deb-src lines in your <FONT FACE="Helvetica">/etc/apt/sources.list</FONT> for this to work. If you supply the `-b' option and you are currently root, then the package will be automatically built if possible.<BR><BR>

<B>apt-get build-dep &lt;package&gt;</B>

Download and install the packages necessary to build the source Debian package &lt;package&gt;.  This feature is only present in <FONT FACE="FIXED">apt</FONT> version 0.5 and up.  Currently this means that woody and above contain this functionality.  If you have an older version of <FONT FACE="FIXED">apt</FONT> then the easiest way to find out the build dependencies is to look in the <FONT FACE="Helvetica">debian/control</FONT> file in the source package directory.  A common usage of this command is in conjunction with <FONT FACE="FIXED">apt-get source -b</FONT>.  For example (as root): 
<P><CENTER><CODE>apt-get build-dep &lt;package&gt; <BR> apt-get source -b &lt;package&gt;</CODE></CENTER></P>
Will download the source package, all of its build dependencies, and attempt to compile the source package.<BR><BR>

<B>dpkg-source -x &lt;package.dsc&gt;</B>

If you have downloaded the source package for a program manually, which includes several files such as a .orig.tar.gz (or .tar.gz if it is Debian native), a .dsc, and a .diff.gz (if it is not Debian native), then you can unpack the source package using this command on the .dsc file.<BR><BR>

<B>dpkg-buildpackage</B>

Builds a Debian package from a Debian source tree.  You must be in the main directory of the source tree for this to work.  Sample usage: 
<P><CENTER><CODE>dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -uc -b</CODE></CENTER></P>
Where `-rfakeroot' instructs it to use the <FONT FACE="FIXED">fakeroot</FONT> program to simulate root privileges (for ownership purposes), `-uc' stands for ``Don't cryptographically sign the changelog'', and `-b' stands for ``Build the binary package only''<BR><BR>

<B>debuild</B>

A handy wrapper script around <FONT FACE="FIXED">dpkg-buildpackage</FONT> that will automatically take care of using <FONT FACE="FIXED">fakeroot</FONT> or not, as well as running <FONT FACE="FIXED">lintian</FONT> and <FONT FACE="FIXED">gpg</FONT> for you. This script is provided by (:program ), so you need to install this package first.<BR><BR>



<H3>Fixing dependencies</H3>
<B>dpkg --configure --pending</B>

If dpkg quits with an error while <FONT FACE="FIXED">apt-get install, upgrade, or dist-upgrade</FONT>ing try running this to configure the packages that were already unpacked. Then try <FONT FACE="FIXED">apt-get install, upgrade, or dist-upgrade -f</FONT>, and then try <FONT FACE="FIXED">apt-get install, upgrade, or dist-upgrade</FONT> again. Repeat as needed. This usually resolves most dependency problems (also, if it mentions a specific package for some reason, you might want to try installing or removing that package)<BR><BR>

<B>apt-get install -f <BR> apt-get upgrade -f <BR> apt-get dist-upgrade -f</B>

Attempt to fix dependencies while doing one of the above. Note that <FONT FACE="FIXED">apt-get install -f</FONT> does not require a &lt;package&gt; argument.<BR><BR>



<H3>See Also</H3>
<B>man &lt;package&gt;</B>

To learn more about this commands you can always consult their man pages, e.g. man apt-get, man dpkg. You can also find information about this and more tools, HOWTOs, manuals, etc at http://www.debian.org/doc/.<BR><BR>
