<code>Asymptote</code> is a powerful descriptive vector graphics language that
provides a mathematical coordinate-based framework for technical drawings. 
Labels and equations are typeset with <code>LaTeX</code>, for overall document
consistency, yielding the same high-quality level of typesetting that
<code>LaTeX</code> provides for scientific text. By default it produces
<code>PostScript</code> output, but it can also generate any format that the
<code>ImageMagick</code> package can produce.

   <p>A major advantage of <code>Asymptote</code> over other graphics packages is
that it is a high-level programming language, as opposed to just a graphics
program: it can therefore exploit the best features of the script
(command-driven) and graphical-user-interface (<acronym>GUI</acronym>) methods for
producing figures. The rudimentary <acronym>GUI</acronym> <code>xasy</code> included with the
package allows one to move script-generated objects
around. To make <code>Asymptote</code> accessible to the average user, this
<acronym>GUI</acronym> is currently being developed into a full-fledged interface
that can generate objects directly. However, the script portion of the language
is now ready for general use by users who are willing to learn a few
simple <code>Asymptote</code> graphics commands (see <a href="Drawing-commands.html#Drawing-commands">Drawing commands</a>).

   <p><code>Asymptote</code> is mathematically oriented (e.g. one can
use complex multiplication to rotate a vector) and uses
<code>LaTeX</code> to do the
typesetting of labels. This is an important feature for scientific
applications. It was inspired by an earlier drawing program (with a weaker
syntax and capabilities) called <code>MetaPost</code>.

   <p>The <code>Asymptote</code> vector graphics language provides:

     <ul>
<li>a standard for typesetting mathematical figures, just
as TeX/<code>LaTeX</code> is the de-facto standard for typesetting equations.

     <li><code>LaTeX</code> typesetting of labels, for overall document consistency;

     <li>the ability to generate and embed 3D vector <acronym>PRC</acronym> graphics within <acronym>PDF</acronym> files;

     <li>a natural coordinate-based framework for technical drawings,
inspired by <code>MetaPost</code>, with a much cleaner, powerful C++-like programming
syntax;

     <li>compilation of figures into virtual machine code for speed, without
sacrificing portability;

     <li>the power of a script-based language coupled to the convenience of
a <acronym>GUI</acronym>;

     <li>customization using its own C++-like graphics programming language;

     <li>sensible defaults for graphical features, with the ability to override;

     <li>a high-level mathematically oriented interface to the
<code>PostScript</code> language for vector graphics, including affine transforms
and complex variables;

     <li>functions that can create new (anonymous) functions;

     <li>deferred drawing that uses the simplex method to solve overall size
constraint issues between fixed-sized objects (labels and arrowheads) and
objects that should scale with figure size;

   </ul>

   <p>Many of the features of <code>Asymptote</code> are written in the
<code>Asymptote</code> language itself. While the stock version of
<code>Asymptote</code> is designed for mathematics typesetting needs, one can
write <code>Asymptote</code> modules that tailor it to specific
applications. A scientific graphing module has already been written
(see <a href="graph.html#graph">graph</a>). Examples of <code>Asymptote</code> code and output,
including animations, are available at
