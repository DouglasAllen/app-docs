<h2><A name="whatisasy">
Question 1.1.  What is Asymptote?
</A></h2>

Asymptote is a vector graphics language designed for
technical graphics, inspired by MetaPost but with IEEE floating-point
numerics, native three-dimensional graphics, Grayscale/RGB/CMYK colourspaces,
and a C++-like syntax. Unlike MetaPost, it natively supports
multiple-segment paths (and hence regions other than simply connected ones), tiling patterns,
Gouraud  shading, tensor patch shading, and PostScript images. 

<h2><A name="whereisasy">
Question 1.2.  How do I obtain Asymptote?
</A></h2>

Binary releases are available for Linux, MacOS X, and Microsoft
Windows platforms, in addition to full source code, from the website
<A href="http://asymptote.sourceforge.net/">http://asymptote.sourceforge.net/</A>.  Many Linux distributions (such as RedHat and Debian) now include an Asymptote package (check
your distribution's documentation for further information about this). 

<h2><A name="beforeasking">
Question 1.3.  Where can I ask questions about Asymptote?

</A></h2>

If you have a question, please try to find an answer in this FAQ, in
the  extensive Asymptote documentation at <A href="http://asymptote.sourceforge.net/doc/">http://asymptote.sourceforge.net/doc/</A>, or search the forum: <A href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=409349">http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=409349</A>.  
<h2><A name="whyasy">
Question 1.4.  Why was the name Asymptote
chosen?
</A></h2>

Well, it isn't the perfect graphics package, but we do think it is
getting there asymptotically...  
<h2><A name="whycamp">
Question 1.5.  In the internal Asymptote source code, what does the
name <code>camp</code> refer to?
</A></h2>

That was our original tentative name for this project, which stood for
 &quot;C's Answer to MetaPost&quot; (the language that inspired
Asymptote).  However, we eventually decided that the name
<code>Asymptote</code> better emphasizes the mathematical and graphical nature of this language.
